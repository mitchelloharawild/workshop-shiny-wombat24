A typical R script evaluates code **sequentially**.

That is, code is ran from **top to bottom** of the page.

`r hr()`

--

.sticker-float[![](images/shiny.svg)]

<br>

Reactive code in a Shiny server **keeps values up to date**.

When inputs change, the output **automatically updates**.

# What is y? 6 or 11?
```

# `r emo::ji("thinking")` Recall: The 'Hello {{name}}!' app

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "Enter your name: "),
  textOutput("greeting")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    sprintf("Hello %s!", input$name)
  })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

--

The code within `renderText()` is **reactive**.

Whenever `input$name` changes, the output text will **update automatically**.


---

# `r emo::ji("mag")` A closer look at reactivity with `reactlog`

The [reactlog package](https://rstudio.github.io/reactlog/) allows you to visualise an app's **reactive graph**.

```{r}
library(reactlog)
```

To **enable logging** of an app's behaviour, run:

```{r}
reactlog_enable()
```

Then **start, use, and stop your app** to fill the log. View the log with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
reactlogShow()
```

Or while your Shiny app is running, press the key combination Ctrl+F3 (Mac: Cmd+F3) to see the reactive log.

# `r emo::ji("scroll")` Create a reactive graph for 'Hello {{name}}!'

# `r emo::ji("bookmark_tabs")` Invalidating reactive objects

Reactive objects are **invalidated** when their **inputs are changed**.

--

In more complicated apps, changing one input can invalidates many objects.

--

<hr>

When a reactive object is invalidated, their dependency graph is **reset**.

--

Reactive objects are then re-calculated, **adding back any dependencies**.

# `r emo::ji("superhero")` Reactive expressions to the rescue

A reactive expression is an **intermediate step** in the reactive workflow.

It accepts inputs and the result can be used as inputs to other reactive code.

Reactive expressions are created with the `reactive()` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
elements_prop <- reactive({ #<<
  elements %>% 
    filter(between(season, input$seasons[1], input$seasons[2])) %>% 
    group_by(element) %>% 
    summarise(proportion = mean(exists)) %>% 
    arrange(desc(proportion)) %>% 
    mutate(element = fct_reorder(element, proportion))
}) #<<
```

This object can be accessed in reactive contexts with `elements_prop()`.

---

# `r emo::ji("computer")` Server specified reactive values

Reactive values are the sources of reactivity (triggers) in an app.

--

`input`: UI defined reactive values allowing user's inputs.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
input$InputID # Access a user's value
```

--

`reactiveValues()`: A list of server defined reactive values.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rv <- reactiveValues(x = TRUE, y = 10)
rv$x # Access a reactive value (creates dependency)
rv$x <- FALSE # Change its value (triggers invalidation)
```

--

`reactiveVal()`: A single server defined reactive value.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- reactiveVal(TRUE)
x() # Access the reactive value (creates dependency)
x(FALSE) # Change its value (triggers invalidation)
```

---

# `r emo::ji("boom")` Reactive contexts

```{r, echo = FALSE}
div(class = "error", 
"Error in .getReactiveEnvironment()$currentContext() : Operation not allowed without an active reactive context. (You tried to do something that can only be done from inside a reactive expression or observer.)")
```

---

# `r emo::ji("boom")` Reactive contexts

```{r, echo = FALSE}
div(class = "error", 
"Caused by error in input$var:<br>
! Can't access reactive value 'var' outside of reactive consumer.<br>
ℹ Do you need to wrap inside reactive() or observe()?")
```

--

**reactive values** (such as `input`) can only be used **within a reactive context**.

A **reactive context** is any section of code that will re-run when the **reactive values** it depends upon update. This includes outputs and intermediate objects that are kept up-to-date.

--

We've seen two reactive contexts to far:

1. `render*()`: Functions to produce UI output
1. `reactive()`: Reactive expressions for intermediate calculations

---

# `r emo::ji("boom")` More reactive contexts

`render*()`: Functions to produce UI output

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output$uppercase <- renderText(toupper(input$text))
```

`reactive()`: Reactive expressions for intermediate calculations

```{r, eval = FALSE}
uppercase <- reactive(toupper(input$text))
```

`eventReactive()`: Reactive expressions with trigger events (more control)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
uppercase <- eventReactive(input$submit, toupper(input$text))
# `uppercase()` will only update when `input$submit` changes (user presses a button).
```

---

# `r emo::ji("boom")` Observer reactive contexts

`observe()`: Trigger arbitrary code on input changes
```{r, eval = FALSE}
observe(print(paste("You clicked submit" input$submit, "times!")))
```

`observeEvent()`: Trigger arbitrary code with trigger events (more control)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
observeEvent(input$submit, print("You clicked submit!"))

### `app.R`: Use `reactive()` expressions for input filtered data

# 🔐 Preventing reactivity

You may not always want the outputs to update. Here's a few reasons:

1. Avoid unwanted triggers (and infinite loops!)
2. Reduce complex calculations
3. Stop computing outputs when inputs aren't ready
4. If the inputs aren't safe.

---

# `r emo::ji("sparkles")` Event driven reactivity

Consider a simple button press counting app, found in `count/event`.

Pressing the "Increment" button adds one to the total, and it can be reset to zero using the "Reset" button. 

Here's the important part of the app's server code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
num <- reactiveVal(0L)
observeEvent(input$add, { #<<
  num(num() + 1L)
}) #<<
```

---

# `r emo::ji("sparkles")` Event driven reactivity

What is the issue if we had used `observe()` instead?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
num <- reactiveVal(0L)
observe({ #<<
  # Despite not changing the output, this adds the button as a trigger dependency
  input$add
  
  num(num() + 1L)
}) #<<
```

.center.bg-blond.box-12[
Not sure? Try running the `count/observe` app.
]

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 1L)
```

---

# `r emo::ji("infinity")` Beware of the infinite loop!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
num <- reactiveVal(0L)
observe({
  # Despite not changing the output, this adds the button as a trigger dependency
  input$add
  
  # However we now also trigger on changes to `num`!
  num(num() + 1L) #<<
})
```

--

The observers are reacting to their own change to `num`!

Updating the reactive value causes an infinite loop, which crashes your app.

--

Previously, `observeEvent()` only updated on the button press event and ignored the change to the reactive value.

---

# Isolating reactive scopes

Event triggers are not available everywhere, and side-effects from `observeEvent()` lead to confusing/bad code.

You can also prevent reactivity using `isolate()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
num <- reactiveVal(0L)
observe({
  # Despite not changing the output, this adds the button as a trigger dependency
  input$add
  
  # We remove the trigger for `num` with `isolate()`.
  num(isolate(num()) + 1L) #<<
})
```

The observer now ignores updates to `num` when invalidating expressions/outputs.

---

# `r emo::ji("racehorse")` Rate limiting (debounce/throttle)

We can also *prevent* reactive triggers happening too frequently.

* Some input updates trigger updates rapidly (typing, sliding).
* Rate limiting prevents/modifies reactivity during input changes.

--

<br>

.box-12.bg-blond.center[
This is important if our code is slow/expensive!

The user doesn't want to wait while adjusting inputs.
]


---

# `r emo::ji("racehorse")` Rate limiting (debounce/throttle)

Shiny has two in-built rate limiting functions:

* `throttle()`: Throttle limits how frequently updates occur  
  `ooo-oo-oo---- => o--o--o--o---`

* `debounce()`: Debounce ignores changes until the changes stop  
  `ooo-oo-oo---- => -----------o-`

--

These functions only work on **reactive expressions** (`reactive()`).

To rate limit an input, we use `debounce(reactive(input$???), millis)`.

---

# `r emo::ji("racehorse")` Waiting to react

Alternatively, consider using `eventReactive()` or `observeEvent()` with an `actionButton()` to trigger reactivity only when the user presses a button.

This is particularly useful if the code is expensive to run, which the user wouldn't want to wait for while selecting their inputs.

---

# `r emo::ji("stop_sign")` Stopping reactivity

A reactive chain can be stopped using `req()`.

You usually want to stop reactive chains when its inputs will cause errors.

Bad inputs are especially common when the app is initialised, as some more dynamic inputs may not be available yet (giving a `NULL` value).

---

# 🦺 Code safety and input validation

Test if the code provided is safe (for example, inputs are in a reasonable range and expected type).

Do not trust the limits on the UI, as these can be ignored by a cheeky user.

The `req()` function is great for validating inputs, for example:

```r
req(is.numeric(input$height))
req(input$num_simulations < 10000)
req(input$num_simulations > 0)
```
---

# 🦺 Code safety and input validation


When using tidyverse (or other non-standard evaluation functions) with user data, use `!!` to match variables outside of the data. For example:

```r
starwars %>% 
  filter(
    between(height, !!input$height[1], !!input$height[2])
  )
```

Too complex for today, but well worth learning - it's useful for more than just Shiny!

A safe way to convert a **text input** to a **variable name** in dplyr is `!!sym(input$variable)`.
